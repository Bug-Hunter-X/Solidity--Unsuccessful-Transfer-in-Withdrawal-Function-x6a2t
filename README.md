# Solidity Unsuccessful Transfer Bug
This repository demonstrates a common bug in Solidity smart contracts: failure to handle potential failures of the `transfer` function when withdrawing funds. The `bug.sol` file contains the buggy code, and `bugSolution.sol` provides a corrected version.

## Bug Description
The `withdraw` function in `bug.sol` does not handle potential issues in the `transfer` function call.  If the transfer fails (e.g., due to an invalid recipient address or insufficient gas), the transaction will revert, but the `balanceOf` will have been already updated, leaving the contract in an inconsistent state.

## Solution
The `bugSolution.sol` file shows the corrected `withdraw` function. It uses a `safeTransfer` function or `call` to handle the possibility of transfer failure and revert only if necessary, preserving the contract's internal consistency.
